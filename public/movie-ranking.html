<h1>The best Movies according to Enrico</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h3>

<p>It was awesome. All of my childhood in one single movie. The easter eggs were great, the character designs too, the world building was cool. The story was simple, as a Mario media shoudl be. 10/10 would raccomend.</p>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>

<p>There's anything more to say?</p>

<h3>Star Wars saga</h3>

<p>Even tho the new trilogy didn't hit as it had to, the first two were awesome.</p>
