<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Enrico Ragone and this is my "About me" section of my personal website. Here you can get to know me a little more, about
  my hobbies, interests and more! 
</p>

<p>I'm a gamer since my early youth. One of my first memory was me at age of 3 playing Super Mario 64 on the old Nintendo64 in my cousins' house. From there, I became
  a gamer because I was really fascinated by the gameplay, the colors etc, then when I grew up, I learned the importance of storytelling, character design,
  world building and voice acting.
</p>

<p>I'm studying to be a web developer while also studying to be a voice actor.</p>
